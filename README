GTK dilatory: run GTK+ applications slowly

General Information
===================

This is a gtk-dilatory, a small debugging utility, which allows to
experience slow GTK+ applications and delays in event processing.


How does it work?
=================

gtk-dilatory installs a simple GTK+ 2 module, which blocks all your
GTK+ 2 applications in a cycle:
- block for 2 sec
- allow them to run for 200 msec


What is the purpose?
====================

This utility is intended for GTK+ library and program developers. It
allows to simulate behavior of the application on a slow devices like
netbooks, PDA or mobile phones.


How to use it?
==============

Simply run your application or environment using:

gtk-dilatory application [ arguments ]

Then heavily test your application.

Typical test case:

Run quickly with your mouse, click somewhere without stopping to move
your mouse. Repeat it several times. Well written application should
behave correctly, just like without any dilatory. If the application
gets bad position of the the click or release, your application or
library needs fix.


How you can fix your application
================================

If you want to react to mouse click or release, never use
gdk_window_get_position() in the handler. Use event->x and event->y
instead. Note that the fix would be a little bit more complicated, as
each of them uses a different coordinate system. You need to fix
coordinated origin as well.
